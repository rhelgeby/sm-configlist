Compiling and Building
======================

Compiling
---------

- Windows: Use compile.bat in the source code repository.
- Linux/Mac: Use the makefile.

The binary will be made in <repos>/build.

The develop environment should be mostly stand-alone with SourcePawn compiler,
some tools and include files.

Linux/Mac requirements:
- Make
- Mercurial

Windows requirements:
- TortoiseHg or Mercurial

Building
--------

The build.sh script will make a complete release with plugin, source, resources
and documents bundled in a zip-archive. The folder structure in the release is
prepared to be extracted in the root game directory (cstrike, tf, etc.) so all
files go in the correct place.

It's also possible to make patches where the build script only package files
that were changed since a certain revision (the full source will always be
included).

In addition the patch build will generate files that describe changes
of text files in individual patches. This is useful to see exactly what's
changed in config files. Add revision numbers to patchlist.conf on separate
lines to generate this changelog. The changes are dumped in the unified diff
format.

The build script is suitable for automatic builds, either in release mode or
patch mode.
